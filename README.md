# Brief Report on the Assignment

## Question 1
We created a probability density function from a geometric series, which was the Geometric Random Variable, and derived expressions for its mean, variance and their likelihood functions. We were then given some summary statistics, using which we found the parameters for the said distribution. We repeated the same for a Poisson distribution and compared the two models. Poisson seemed to be a better fit for the model 

## Question 2
We were tasked with builidng a function that returns the MLE of $log(\alpha)$, where $\alpha$ is a parameter of $\Gamma(\alpha,\sigma)$. We then demonstrated the theory of sampling distributions by sampling 20 random points from $\Gamma(\alpha, \sigma)$ and finding the MLE of $log(\alpha)$ using this sample. We repeat this process 1000 times and plot a histogram. It was observed that the column with modal frequency lies close to the expected value of MLE ($log(1.5)=0.41$). We also note that the gap between the $2.5^{th}$ and the $97.5^{th}$ percentile reduces as sample size increases, indicating that as $n$ increases, sampling distribution becomes more accurate to the true value.
